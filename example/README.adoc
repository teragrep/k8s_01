# Usage

Run `run.sh` to start example cluster.

Run `stop.sh` to stop the example cluster.

The container `receiver` is the destination relp server and it will print to stdout any relp messages received. You can follow the logs with the command `kubectl logs -f receiver`

It automatically patches relp server and kubernetes url so it should work automatically as-is in minikube.
